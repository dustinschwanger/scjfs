## Performance Considerations

- Optimized for Core Web Vitals
- No heavy JavaScript dependencies
- Lazy-load images when implemented

**Recommendations:**
- Compress images (county seal, map) before upload
- Enable gzip compression on server
- Implement browser caching
- Consider loading USWDS locally for production (faster than CDN)

---

## Next Steps

   - Export county seal as PNG
   - Create/capture location map image

2. **Test Across Devices**
   - Desktop (various screen sizes)
   - Tablet (iPad, Android)
   - Mobile (iOS, Android)

3. **Accessibility Audit**
   - Run WAVE tool
   - Test with screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Keyboard navigation testing

4. **Content Review**
   - Verify all phone numbers
   - Check email addresses
   - Confirm office hours
   - Update leadership names if needed

5. **Additional Pages**
   - Apply same design system to other pages
   - Create templates for:
     - Service detail pages
     - Application forms
     - Contact page
     - News/updates page

6. **Integration**
   - Connect to backend systems (if applicable)
   - Add form submission handlers
   - Integrate analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)
